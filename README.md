## Overview
The COVID-19 Data Exploration project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across various locations globally. Utilizing advanced SQL techniques, the project focuses on examining infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination statistics to derive meaningful insights.

## SQL Skills Used
- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Creating Views
- Converting Data Types

 ## Software requirements:
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): To run SQL queries and manage the database.

  ## Summary Results
The analysis provided several key insights:
- Likelihood of Death: Calculated the death percentage for infected individuals, highlighting the severity of the pandemic.
- Infection Rates: Determined the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 across different countries.
- High Infection and Death Rates: Identified countries and continents with the highest infection rates and death counts, allowing for targeted health interventions.
- Vaccination Impact: Analyzed the vaccination rollout and its impact on the population, providing critical data for public health policies.
- These insights enable better decision-making and resource allocation to combat the pandemic effectively.Data Management and Processes
